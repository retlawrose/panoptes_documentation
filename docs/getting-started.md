## Welcome to Panoptes

Are you interested in finding out what Panoptes is all about?  Try the orbital view of Panoptes at 
[Concepts](concepts.md).  If that doesn't intimidate, you can dive into the 
[Panoptes Reference Documents](./panoptes-reference/objects-and-abstraction.md).  `Panoptes Reference` is code-related 
documentation.

If you want to try running this, we did produce a workbench version of Panoptes jammed into a single docker container.
The Dockerfile can be located at [github.com/yahoo/panoptes_docker](https://github.com/yahoo/panoptes_docker).

If you prefer to run on a virtual machine, or want to install to bare metal, take a look at the 
[Installation guide](./user-guide/installation.md) and the [Usage guide](./user-guide/usage.md). `user guide` in general
refers to the running and operations of Panoptes.

## Getting Involved

First up, we're going to need people to adhere to our [Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.md), and if you're planning to
contribute code, follow the steps in the [contribute](contribute.md) document.

We also accept bug requests on the [Panoptes Issue](https://github.com/yahoo/panoptes/issues) system or informal chats 
via Slack at [panoptescommunity.slack.com](https://panoptescommunity.slack.com/).
